# StreamingUDP
This document details a streaming UDP protocol between and OCU and a Robotic Asset. The stream is intended to simplify the command and control signaling used to steer a UGV that is guided by a Kairos Pronto4 Series4 or Pronto4 Uomo. Since these are early versions of this document, it is expected to change throughout implementation and testing
